# TeamfiveProject

This was the Front End project we created as a team of 5. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Project C

The following criteria were evaluated:

Business webpage
- The main target for this endeavour is to show the portfolio and make an easy and effective contact page for the customer to contact the Business. 

The webpage should have: 

**Navbar**
- You can choose what kind of navbar you want to use. 

**Landing image**
- How to use the Hero’s image section is up to you. Be impactant though. 

**Portfolio**
- That’s the main section in the webpage. Try to find the best way to show customers the Businesses work. The pictures attached to the project can be used to this section. Be creative, remember that a Business work doesn't necessarily follow only one theme. 

**Awards(Optional)**
- Has the Business any awards or certificates? Essential to be displayed. 

**Bio/About**
- Bio/About page, apart from the portfolio, the bio could help to keep the interest of the customer, empathy is a powerful weapon. 

**Testimonials**
- The best way to conquer somebody's trust, the opinion of a third person...  

**Customers**
- If the Business has ever made any job for en Enterprise, it should be shown too. 

**Contact/Register**
- Create a contact page to connect customers and Business. 

**Media**
- Very important to have icons to social media. (Please note that the icons wont have any link).
- Requirements: Website must be fully responsive (you are allowed to use 100% free theme elements if they are without any copyrighted restrictions and of course you must implement them in combination with your styles - using just prepared theme without your styles is not allowed). You are allowed to divide the page into sections, but it must have at least 3 more independent pages apart from the index page.
